              <h3>Honeypot: Project to Demonstrate Network Security Systems</h3>
              <p>
                The purpose of this project was to identify one of the eight CISSP 
                domains that I had a keen interest in. Within that domain, I narrowed 
                down my topic and chose to do the project on the honeypot security 
                concept to explore in depth. This project consists of a step-by-step on 
                how to set up a honeypot and expose it to the internet to try and collect 
                data traffic and information on adversaries. It is also recommended that 
                the use of honeypot should be used as enticement and not entrapment. The 
                pictures shown are some commands I used for the installion process.

              <h3>Smart Doorbell: Device Penetration Testing</h3>
              <p>
                The purpose of this project was to conduct research and further analysis on 
                the selected device. We have found from part one of the reports that the 
                processor on the device that manages the input/output as well as the system 
                itself, runs on FreeRTOS. The camera has an HD interface, motion detection, 
                night vision, two-way audio, and cloud storage. The team was able to gather 
                information from Wireshark and found that in addition to the common protocols 
                such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, TLS, and DNS. The team had two doorbells, one that was 
                used for data analysis, while the other was used for component analysis. In addition 
                to this, one device was updated to the latest version and the other was kept in the 
                default version. The devices have an application that is compatible with Android and 
                iOS and uses an SD card, phone, or cloud for storage.

              <h3>Client Runbook</h3>
              <p>
                The client runbook is a document of the client's alerts, whether it be critical, 
                non-critical, True Positive (TP), or False Positive (FP). It helps and guides others 
                with similar alerts make sound decisions to escalate the incident or mark it as FP.

              <h3>Client Monthly Report</h3>
              <p>
                I was tasked to do the client's monthly report. The report consists of sorting the 
                critical alerts first, exporting the file to excel, and lastly adding the table to 
                its appropriate page on Stellar Cyber. The monthly report shows the overall alerts 
                within the month ranging from critical to non-critical. It provides the client a more 
                in depth analysis, and provides us the opportunity to sit with the client and discuss 
                tuning of alerts and actions to be done.

            <p>
              I am a graduate student at Boise State University. I am currently getting my
              master's in Cybersecurity, and got my bachelor's in Accounting. It has always
              been my interest to expereince the 'best of both worlds.' I am doing my internship 
              at BSU Cyberdome Institute for Pervasive Cybersecurity. I am fueled by my passion 
              for problem solving and love challenges. I consider myself a 'forever student,' 
              eager to both build my academic foundations and gain certifications, and stay 
              in tune with Cybersecurity news. My hunger for knowledge and determination to 
              turn information into action has contributed to my work as a student at BSU and 
              an Information Security Analyst at Cyberdome.
